# Assets

This directory contains all the images and sound used in the game
as well as a `config.json` file with all the changeable properties
of the game. Students just need to change the stuff here to personalize
their own games. Things can get crazy fun by changing the gravity
and speed settings, for example, of `pipe` and `flappy` in the
`config.json` file.

## Creating an Configurable Web Interface

At some point a simple web service will be created where beginning
students and the public can simply authenticate to GitHub and point
to a `flappy-assets` repo to create their own games without having
the code at all.
